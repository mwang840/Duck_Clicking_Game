# Duck_Clicking_Game
A simple Duck Clicking Game that is made in unity. This is my first attempt of learning unity and making sprites move (major upgrade from Scratch)
<h1>Features: </h1>
<ul>
  <li>Ducks which spawn at (0, 0) and travel different speeds</li>
  <li>Player can click on the duck which increases the score by 1</h1>
  
  </ul>
  
  I will add more features as this game goes on.
  
  Only current issue is releasing the exe so that others can play the game
